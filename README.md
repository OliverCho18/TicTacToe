This is a TicTacToe Game meant to run in the command prompt or terminal.
Once running the game will ask the user to enter a coordinate based on the grid
below. The coordinate you select will be where your x or o is placed.
-------------
|1,1|2,1|3,1|
-------------
|1,2|2,2|3,2|
-------------
|1,3|2.3|3,3|

Below is an example of what you will see in your terminal. As you can see I have
selected 1 1 as my first location and piece has been placed there.
